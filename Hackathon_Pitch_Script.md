# Hackathon Pitch Script: Axiom Signal

## 🎤 Part 1: The Hook (0:00 - 1:00)
**Goal**: Define the problem and our visionary solution.

> "Every developer knows the 'Black Hole' of a technical project. You research a dozen tools, make fifty micro-decisions, and type thousand of lines of code. But a week later, you forget *why* you chose Redis over Postgres, or how you solved that Tokyo concurrency bug. The technical journey is fragmented, scattered across terminal logs, half-written notes, and memory.
>
> We built **Axiom Signal**.
> 
> Axiom is the Technical Sensemaking Engine. It's not a note-taker; it's an **Expert Observer**. Using real-time RAG and proactive reasoning agents, Axiom traces your architectural narrative as it happens, ensuring every decision is captured, every contradiction is flagged, and every milestone is pitch-ready."

## 🛠️ Part 2: Feature Walkthrough (The Demo)

### 1. Real-time capture & Live RAG
*   **Show**: Open the "Write Journal" page. Start typing a technical thought (e.g., *"Considering Rust for the backend because the Node.js API is hitting concurrency limits"*).
*   **Voiceover**: "Notice how I'm just thinking out loud. But look at the Assistant Panel on the right. Axiom isn't waiting. It's fetching my past decisions about 'Node.js limits' and 'Rust prototypes' in real-time, providing immediate architectural context."

### 2. Proactive Advice & Pattern Detection
*   **Show**: Navigate to the Dashboard. Point out a "Proactive Notification" card.
*   **Voiceover**: "Axiom works in the background. It noticed that two days ago I wanted to 'Keep it Simple' but today I'm 'Adding K8s for a tiny app.' It flags this **Strategic Contradiction** immediately, saving me from hours of unnecessary complexity."

### 3. Decisions & "Axiom with Power"
*   **Show**: Run the "Decide Now" task on a pending item.
*   **Voiceover**: "When I'm stuck, I use 'Axiom with Power'. Our reasoning engine doesn't just give a 'Yes' or 'No'. It runs a multi-step audit: Market Signal, Freshness, and Friction Estimation. It gives me a structured verdict with a 90% confidence score and immediate action items."

### 4. Executive Pitch Mode (The Finale)
*   **Show**: Click "Generate Pitch" in the Journal view.
*   **Voiceover**: "And for the judges—this is the 'Executive Pitch Mode'. In one click, it synthesizes my chaotic scattered notes into this premium, five-pillar narrative. It shows our Vision, Architecture, and Roadmap, perfectly formatted for a stakeholder review."

## 🏗️ Part 3: Technical Deep-Dive (For the Judges)
**Goal**: Show the engineering depth.

> "Under the hood, Axiom is a hybrid powerhouse. We use a **MERN stack** for the core UI, but the intelligence layer is a **Rust & Python** partnership. We use **LangGraph** for deterministic AI workflows and **Redis Vector Store** for high-speed retrieval. We aren't just calling an API; we are merging live memory with curated technical history."

---

## 🏁 Part 4: The Closing (The "Winning" Statement)

> "Axiom Signal turns 'chaos' into 'capital'. It ensures that the technical genius behind a hackathon project isn't lost in the terminal—it's preserved, analyzed, and ready to scale. 
> 
> **Axiom Signal: High Signal. No Noise. Pure Vision.**"

### 💡 Demo Tips for Success:
1. **Use the Dark Mode**: The gold/blue accents look best in high contrast.
2. **Type Meaningful Text**: Don't just type 'test'. Type something real like *"Tokyo library is hard to learn"*.
3. **Show the History**: The timeline is the "Visual proof" of the journey.
