# Axiom — Core Scenarios (v0)

This document defines the initial real-world scenarios Axiom is designed to reason about.
These scenarios guide prompt design, agent workflows, evaluation, and demos.

## Scenario 1: CS Student Entering the Job Market

### User Profile
- Stage: 3rd-year CS student
- Interests: Backend engineering, AI
- Goal: Transition from jobs → AI research/development
- Risk tolerance: Medium
- Time horizon: 6–18 months
- Motivation: Build strong fundamentals while exploring emerging tech

### Core Question
Should I care about **LangGraph** right now?

### What Axiom Must Decide
- Is LangGraph worth learning at this stage?
- Does it build transferable skills or niche exposure?
- What is the opportunity cost vs fundamentals?

## Scenario 2: Early-career Backend Engineer (Industry)

### User Profile
- Stage: Backend engineer (~2 years experience)
- Context: Working in a production environment
- Goal: Improve compensation and job stability
- Risk tolerance: Low–medium
- Time horizon: 12–24 months
- Motivation: Avoid hype, invest only in proven leverage

### Core Question
Should I care about **LangGraph** right now?

### What Axiom Must Decide
- Is LangGraph production-relevant today?
- Who is paying for this skill right now?

## Scenario 3 (Optional Backup): Indie Hacker / Solo Founder

### Only add this if you have time later — not required for Day 0.
“I’m a solo founder building small SaaS products.
I care about speed, leverage, and differentiation more than purity.
I’m willing to use immature tools if they give me an edge.
Should I care about LangGraph right now?”

This scenario often flips the verdict:
“Yes, adopt early”
“Competitive advantage if used correctly”
“High risk, high leverage”

But again — don’t add now unless you’re confident.

## Why These Scenarios Matter

Both scenarios ask the same question about the same technology,
but require different answers based on incentives, risk, and goals.

Axiom’s value is in producing **context-sensitive, explainable decisions** —
not generic summaries.
